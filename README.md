# GRIPS-UMAP-Practice

1. Uploading the dataset

2. Standard visualization techniques(pairplot and phik correlation matrix)

3. UMAP Dimension Reduction without parameter experimentation

4. UMAP Dimension Reduction with parameter n_neighbors

5. UMAP Dimension Reduction with parameter min_dist

6. UMAP Dimension Reduction with parameter n_components


Note: the 3d visualization in the n_components section has a rotable graph when you run the scripts
